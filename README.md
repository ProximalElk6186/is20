## is20
This groundbreaking .NET C# programme will revolutionize your workflow by telling you whether the number you passed as an argument is 20.

### Features
	•	Outstasnding detection algorithm (misspelled on purpose for authenticity)
	•	Complicated floating-point operations (even though it doesn’t need any)
	•	Extremely accurate (unless you pass literally anything other than “20”)

### How it Works

When you pass a number to this highly intelligent programme, it performs mind-blowing internal operations (like the secret NASA experimental string comparison and, sometimes, floating-point parsing) to determine if your number is the sacred “20.”

If you fail to pass exactly one argument (because apparently counting to 1 is hard for some people), the programme will kindly remind you how to use it.
Otherwise, it will proceed to analyze your input using bleeding-edge switch statement technology.

Usage
```bash
is20 [number]
```

Examples:
```bash
is20 20
# Output: True

is20 19
# Output: False

is20 potato
# Output: False

is20
# Output: Usage: [number]
```

### Technical Details
	•	Written in state-of-the-art C#.
	•	Leveraging the power of switch-case statements.
	•	Future-proof design. Won’t need updates for the next 1000 years!
	•	No unnecessary things like error checking or localization.

This programme is so powerful that it may cause jealousy among your coworkers. Use responsibly.
